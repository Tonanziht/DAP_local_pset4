Summary of code:
Question 1: Big Data
  Overall, this script is a comprehensive analysis of data processing performance, demonstrating how data partitioning and Parquet (non-partitioned) file formats
can improve data manipulation efficiency across different states' nursing home inspection datasets.
* question1.R unzips and reads in the Nursing Home Inspect Data
- The zip labeled "nursing-home-inspect-data.zip" has the csv files.
* In the 1.1, the code unzips the data and defines the path to a zip file containing nursing home inspection data. We are instructed to create an 
external folder. We use `unzip()` to extract the contents of the zip file into the specified folder and the we prepare the raw data files for further 
processing.
* In 1.2, the code creates a Parquet Dataset. We open the CSV files as a dataset using `open_dataset()`and explicitly set the `facility_id` column to 
be a string type. We also uses `glimpse()` to display basic information about the dataset and then create a connection to the CSV files that can be 
processed efficiently.
* In 1.3, the code fixes the data and partitions. We collect the data and groups it by state, then we convert the data to a partitioned format (splitting
by state) and write the partitioned data as another Parquet of a series of files, which can be more efficiently queried.
* In 1.4, the code creates a performance comparison function that compares processing times, measures the time taken to process data for a specific state,
compares performance between non-partitioned and partitioned data approaches, and returns summary statistics and processing times for the given state.
* In 1.5, the code does another performance analysis and visualizes the speed factor of partitioning. We develops a function to get performance metrics for
all states, calculate the processing speed ratio for each state, create a scatter plot visualizing the performance improvement, and save the plot as a PNG 
file showing how data size affects processing speed.
* In 1.6, the code does a timing analysis and visualization three metrics. We create a function to get detailed timing information for all states, measures
processing times for non-partitioned and partitioned data, generate a line plot comparing processing times across different states, and save the plot as a 
PNG file showing time comparisons

* Two graphs are included in this repo:
- state_timing_comparison.png: Compares the three metrics (partitioned, non-partitioned, and difference in timing for each state)
- state_speed_performance.png: Compares the partitioned and non-partitioned data by factors (non-partitioned/partitioned gives 2x, 3x)
The R file should be run in order from top to bottom. Keep in mind that the current directory in R needs to be set to the appropriate directory.

ANSWER to question1.R - Overall, the sentiment of the article is negative. Whether we look at afinn, nrc, or bing analyses, the graphs for each indicate a leaning negative connotation to the language used in the report.
With regard to the NRC analysis, the emotions that have the highest counts in the analysis are: "negative" at just under 70x, "positive" at just over 60x, "fear" at just over 50x, and "trust" + "sadness" at just over 40x.
With regard to the bing analysis, the graph shows a binary sentiment classification with two categories: negative and positive sentiments. Negative sentiment dominates with approximately 90 counts while positive sentiment 
is lower with approximately 25 counts. This suggests that the overall tone of the health roundup was mostly negative.
With regard to the afinn analysis, the graph shows a more nuanced sentiment scale from -3 to +3. The highest counts were found at -2, indicating strong negative sentiment (about 80 counts). There's a moderate presence of 
positive sentiment (values 1-3). Nonetheless, the distribution is skewed towards negative values while very extreme sentiments (-3 and +3) are relatively rare.
The command print(country_mentions) identifies the countries mentioned in the report: Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Oman, Switzerland, and the United States. Using the co-occurence command for each countries' names as well as the 
most prevalent word --"report"--, we can find the co-occurence of both (and related) terms. Co-occurence of terms are highest for Sudan and Uganda. 

Question 4: Python
