Summary of code:
Question 1: Big Data
  Overall, this script is a comprehensive analysis of data processing performance, demonstrating how data partitioning and Parquet (non-partitioned) file formats
can improve data manipulation efficiency across different states' nursing home inspection datasets.
* question1.R unzips and reads in the Nursing Home Inspect Data
- The zip labeled "nursing-home-inspect-data.zip" has the csv files.
* In the 1.1, the code unzips the data and defines the path to a zip file containing nursing home inspection data. We are instructed to create an 
external folder. We use `unzip()` to extract the contents of the zip file into the specified folder and the we prepare the raw data files for further 
processing.
* In 1.2, the code creates a Parquet Dataset. We open the CSV files as a dataset using `open_dataset()`and explicitly set the `facility_id` column to 
be a string type. We also uses `glimpse()` to display basic information about the dataset and then create a connection to the CSV files that can be 
processed efficiently.
* In 1.3, the code fixes the data and partitions. We collect the data and groups it by state, then we convert the data to a partitioned format (splitting
by state) and write the partitioned data as another Parquet of a series of files, which can be more efficiently queried.
* In 1.4, the code creates a performance comparison function that compares processing times, measures the time taken to process data for a specific state,
compares performance between non-partitioned and partitioned data approaches, and returns summary statistics and processing times for the given state.
* In 1.5, the code does another performance analysis and visualizes the speed factor of partitioning. We develops a function to get performance metrics for
all states, calculate the processing speed ratio for each state, create a scatter plot visualizing the performance improvement, and save the plot as a PNG 
file showing how data size affects processing speed.
* In 1.6, the code does a timing analysis and visualization three metrics. We create a function to get detailed timing information for all states, measures
processing times for non-partitioned and partitioned data, generate a line plot comparing processing times across different states, and save the plot as a 
PNG file showing time comparisons

* Two graphs are included in this repo:
- state_timing_comparison.png: Compares the three metrics (partitioned, non-partitioned, and difference in timing for each state)
- state_speed_performance.png: Compares the partitioned and non-partitioned data by factors (non-partitioned/partitioned gives 2x, 3x)
The R file should be run in order from top to bottom. Keep in mind that the current directory in R needs to be set to the appropriate directory.

ANSWER to question1.R - 


Question 2: Python
ANSWER to Q2.2 - The code basically creates a word game that picks a random 5-letter word and the user must to try to guess it. The user gets 5 chances to figure
it out. After each guess, the game tells you which letters you got right and if any letters are in the right spot. The user must first run the program, type in 
any 5-letter word and hit enter, and then the game will show you which letters you got right. For example, if you guess "APPLE" and the answer is "NERVE", it'll 
show "____e" . The underscore (_) means that letter was wrong and any letters shown mean you got them in the exact right spot! The code makes it so that the user 
only gets 5 tries and can only enter 5-letter words. No numbers or special characters are allowed and it doesn't matter if you use uppercase or lowercase letters. 
Though the game looks simple, the code has to do alot by making sure the inputs are valid, withing the 5 letter condition, and indicate through dynamic reponses if
the user has the wrong answer, if the inputted word is invalid, how many attempts the user has left, if the answer is correct, and what letters match the right answer
if a similar word is given.
